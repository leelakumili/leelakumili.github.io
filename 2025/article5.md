## AI vs. ML vs. DL

| Feature            | AI (Artificial Intelligence) | ML (Machine Learning) | DL (Deep Learning) |
|--------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Definition**     | Broad field of building intelligent systems | A subset of AI where models learn from data | A subset of ML using deep neural networks |
| **Key Characteristic** | Can include rule-based systems & decision-making | Uses algorithms to find patterns & make predictions | Uses multi-layered neural networks for complex tasks |
| **Example**       | Chatbots, self-driving cars, fraud detection | Spam email filtering, recommendation systems | Image recognition, speech-to-text conversion |


## LLM vs. NLP vs. Transformer

| Feature            | LLM (Large Language Model) | NLP (Natural Language Processing) | Transformer |
|--------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|------------|
| **Definition**     | A specific type of AI model trained on vast text data for generating language | The broader field of AI enabling machines to understand & process language | A deep learning architecture used to train LLMs |
| **Key Characteristic** | Pre-trained on massive datasets, capable of generating text | Includes text analysis, speech recognition, sentiment analysis | Enables efficient processing of sequential data (e.g., ChatGPT is based on this) |
| **Example**       | GPT-4, Gemini | Speech-to-text, machine translation, chatbots | GPT |



## Fine-Tuning vs. Prompt Engineering vs. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

| Feature            | Fine-Tuning | Prompt Engineering | RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) |
|--------------------|------------|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Definition**     | Adapting a pre-trained model to a specific dataset or task | Crafting inputs (prompts) to get desired responses from an AI model | Enhancing AI outputs by integrating real-time external data |
| **Key Characteristic** | Changes model weights for domain-specific improvements | Does not change the model, only refines how input is structured | Mixes static model knowledge with fresh, retrieved data |
| **Example**       | Training GPT on legal documents for law-related queries | Adjusting prompts to get more accurate AI responses | Using a search tool alongside AI for up-to-date answers |




## Chatbot vs. Virtual Assistant vs. AI Agent

| Feature            | Chatbot | Virtual Assistant | AI Agent |
|--------------------|---------|------------------|----------|
| **Definition**     | AI designed for text-based conversations | AI that assists with tasks like scheduling, reminders, and smart home control | AI that can independently execute tasks & make decisions |
| **Key Characteristic** | Simple Q&A or rule-based responses | More advanced, can handle voice commands & integrate apps | Can analyze data, take actions, and learn over time |
| **Example**       | Website customer support bot | Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant | AI stock trading bot, self-driving car system |



## AI Orchestration vs. AI Crew vs. Autonomous AI Agent

| Feature            | AI Crew | AI Orchestration | Autonomous AI Agents |
|--------------------|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Collaboration**  | Multiple AI agents working together | AI systems coordinated in a structured workflow | Acts independently |
| **Control**        | Decentralized | Centralized | Self-directed |
| **Decision-making** | Individual AIs focus on specialized tasks | A system (orchestrator) coordinates AI interactions | AI decides & executes actions on its own |
| **Example Use Case** | AI-driven e-commerce (recommendations, pricing, fraud detection) | AI workflow for automated content generation | AI stock trading bot managing investments |
