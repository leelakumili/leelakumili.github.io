## **🚀 AI Glossary: Essential Terms for Engineers**  

### **🔹 General AI Terms**  
- **AI (Artificial Intelligence)** – The broad field of developing systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence, such as problem-solving and decision-making.  
- **AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)** – A hypothetical AI with reasoning abilities comparable to humans, capable of learning across any domain.  
- **Machine Learning (ML)** – A subset of AI where models learn from data to make predictions or decisions.  
- **Deep Learning (DL)** – A subset of ML that leverages multi-layered neural networks for complex pattern recognition.  
- **Neural Network** – A computing system inspired by the human brain, consisting of layers of nodes (neurons) that process information.  

### **🔹 AI Models & Architectures**  
- **LLM (Large Language Model)** – AI trained on vast amounts of text to generate human-like responses (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini).  
- **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** – The field of AI enabling machines to understand and generate human language.  
- **Transformer** – The deep learning architecture behind LLMs, enabling efficient parallel processing of text.  
- **Multi-Modal AI** – AI that processes multiple data types (text, images, audio).  

### **🔹 Training & Optimization**  
- **Fine-Tuning** – Adapting a pre-trained AI model for a specialized task or dataset.  
- **Zero-Shot Learning** – When an AI performs tasks it hasn't been explicitly trained on.  
- **Few-Shot Learning** – Learning from only a small number of examples.  
- **Self-Supervised Learning** – AI learning from raw data without explicit labels.  
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** – Training AI agents to optimize actions by rewarding desired behaviors.  

### **🔹 AI Applications & Use Cases**  
- **Generative AI** – AI that generates content like text, images, and code rather than just analyzing data.  
- **Autonomous AI** – AI that operates independently, making decisions and taking actions.  
- **AI Agent** – A system that performs tasks, makes decisions, or interacts with users based on AI models.  
- **AI Crew** – A group of AI agents working together to complete a complex task.  
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** – A technique that improves AI responses by combining real-time search retrieval with generative AI.  
- **Chatbot** – AI-powered conversational system interacting with users via text or voice.  
- **Virtual Assistant** – AI-powered tools that handle tasks like scheduling and answering queries (e.g., Siri, Alexa).  

### **🔹 AI Development & Interaction**  
- **Prompt** – The input given to an AI model to generate a specific response.  
- **Prompt Engineering** – Crafting prompts to optimize AI responses for accuracy and relevance.  
- **Output** – The response generated by an AI model.  
- **Workflow** – A sequence of AI-driven steps to complete a task efficiently.  
- **AI Persona** – A predefined AI behavior/personality that influences responses.
