## LLM vs. NLP vs. Transformer

| Feature            | LLM (Large Language Model) | NLP (Natural Language Processing) | Transformer |
|--------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|------------|
| **Definition**     | A specific type of AI model trained on vast text data for generating language | The broader field of AI enabling machines to understand & process language | A deep learning architecture used to train LLMs |
| **Key Characteristic** | Pre-trained on massive datasets, capable of generating text | Includes text analysis, speech recognition, sentiment analysis | Enables efficient processing of sequential data (e.g., ChatGPT is based on this) |
| **Example**       | GPT-4, Gemini | Speech-to-text, machine translation, chatbots | GPT |
