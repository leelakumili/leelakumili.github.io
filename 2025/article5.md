## Fine-Tuning vs. Prompt Engineering vs. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

| Feature            | Fine-Tuning | Prompt Engineering | RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) |
|--------------------|------------|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Definition**     | Adapting a pre-trained model to a specific dataset or task | Crafting inputs (prompts) to get desired responses from an AI model | Enhancing AI outputs by integrating real-time external data |
| **Key Characteristic** | Changes model weights for domain-specific improvements | Does not change the model, only refines how input is structured | Mixes static model knowledge with fresh, retrieved data |
| **Example**       | Training GPT on legal documents for law-related queries | Adjusting prompts to get more accurate AI responses | Using a search tool alongside AI for up-to-date answers |
