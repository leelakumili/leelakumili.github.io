# The Engineer’s Guide to Getting Buy-In and Driving Change

I was checking all the boxes, but nothing was clicking.

I was writing solid code, solving hard problems, doing the “right” things—but somehow, I wasn’t breaking through. My ideas and opinions were often appreciated, but they rarely gained traction. They’d be acknowledged, but then quietly fade away without creating real change. My impact felt muted. And I couldn’t quite figure out why.

Recently, I reached out to a few senior folks in my organization—asking for mentorship, feedback, and perspective. Through their lens, and after some tough moments of reflection, I started to notice a pattern.

There are skills no one really teaches us as engineers. Skills that don’t show up in performance rubrics or pull request comments—but quietly shape how far we go, how much we’re heard, and how much change we can drive.

I’m talking about the ability to sell and influence.

It’s something I’m just starting to learn, something I wish I’d known earlier, and—just as importantly—something I’m working to unlearn some old habits around, too.

## Why Selling and Influencing Matter in Engineering

As engineers, we’re often taught that great work speaks for itself. That if the code is clean, the architecture is sound, and the problems are well-solved, the impact will naturally follow.

But that’s only half the story.

In reality, how we communicate our ideas, how we bring others along, and how we navigate resistance are just as important as the technical solution itself.

Selling and influencing aren’t about being persuasive for the sake of recognition or credit—they’re about creating alignment, building trust, and making sure the right ideas get the momentum they deserve.

## So, What’s the Difference?

At first, I used these words interchangeably. But I’ve come to see that while they’re related, selling and influencing serve different purposes—and knowing which to lean on can make a huge difference.

### Selling

Selling is about making a clear case and asking for action. It’s direct, focused, and often tied to a decision or commitment.

In engineering, this could look like:

- Convincing your manager to prioritize a tech debt cleanup.
- Pitching a new tool or architecture to leadership.
- Getting buy-in for a spike or a proof of concept.

Selling requires clarity, urgency, and a well-framed value proposition. It’s about helping others see why your idea matters—and why it matters now.

### Influencing

Influence, on the other hand, is slower and subtler. It’s about shaping perspectives over time, building relationships, and planting seeds that might take weeks or months to grow.

This shows up when:

- You model better practices and hope the team adopts them.
- You help shift the culture toward documentation or testing.
- You mentor others quietly, without formal authority.

Influence relies on credibility, empathy, and consistency. It’s what earns you trust—even before you ask for anything.

## When to Use Each

One of the biggest things I’m learning is how to read the room.

If I need a fast decision or resource commitment, I lean into selling. If I’m working toward long-term change or culture shifts, I focus on influencing.

Sometimes, they overlap. I might sell a small step now and influence broader adoption over time. Or I might influence quietly in the background until the moment is right to make a pitch.

## How I’m Starting to Practice These Skills

I’m still early in the journey, but here’s how I’m trying to apply what I’ve learned so far:

### 1. Develop My Communication Skills

Whether I’m persuading or guiding, effective communication is everything. The best communicators adapt to their audience, listen actively, and make their ideas relatable.

**Trying:** I visualize conversations and anticipate how the other person might respond. Tools like ChatGPT help me test different approaches and refine my communication.

### 2. Build Trust and Credibility

Influence is built on trust. I aim to show up consistently, deliver on promises, and make my technical strengths visible—not just through code, but in how I support and collaborate with others.

**Trying:** I share small wins and lessons learned in team forums, focusing on providing constructive feedback only when I feel strongly about an issue. For everything else, I let it go to help foster a positive and collaborative environment.

### 3. Build Relationships, Not Just Cases

Influence thrives on relationships. I’m investing more time in listening to others, understanding their perspectives, and showing up consistently in team forums.

**Trying:** I make an effort to engage in casual coffee talks and discussions beyond projects, asking about others' goals and challenges, and offering support where I can.

### 4. Learn from People Who Do It Well

I’ve started observing how senior or leaders present their ideas, handle pushback, and frame discussions. It’s not magic—it’s practice, intentionality, and emotional intelligence. I’m taking notes on their approach and trying to apply similar strategies.

**Trying:** I pay attention to how senior leaders navigate conversations, both in formal meetings and casual settings. I note how they handle objections, present ideas, and manage the flow of discussions, then incorporate those strategies into my own approach.

## In Closing

No one ever told me that “getting buy-in” was part of the job. But now, I see it clearly: technical skills open the door, but influence and communication help you walk through it—and bring others with you.

If you’ve ever felt like your ideas weren’t landing, or like your impact wasn’t matching your effort, you’re not alone. These are skills we can all learn, and unlearn, and grow into.

The best part? You don’t have to wait for permission.

Start small. Speak up. Share context. Ask questions. Build trust. Frame ideas. Invite feedback. The more we practice these quiet, human skills, the more our technical work can truly shine.
