# Why Are We Still Building Products Customers Accept as Good Enough Instead of Products They Truly Love?

For years, MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and MVE (Minimum Viable Experiment) have been the cornerstones of product development. They served their purpose in an era where speed-to-market and idea validation were the primary goals. But as we step into a new year, it’s clear the rules of the game have changed.

"Wait a minute," you might think. "Isn’t product development someone else’s problem? Why are we engineers talking about this?"

Here’s the deal: Being a good engineer isn’t just about writing clean code or architecting scalable systems—it’s about knowing what’s worth building and where to focus efforts. Understanding frameworks like MAC ensures you don’t end up over-engineering features no one wants or wasting time on ideas that won’t work. As engineers, understanding the purpose and intent behind product development is key to unlocking the potential of what we build. It allows us to create products that don’t just function, but delight and provide real value to customers.

Today, customers expect more than just "viable." They demand products that deliver seamless, reliable value from the moment they engage. They don’t want to settle for clunky solutions that barely meet their needs; they want thoughtful, scalable systems that make their lives easier. Solutions that address the entire problem, no matter how small. It’s not about just ticking a box; it’s about ensuring that the entire experience is complete, smooth, and reliable, from start to finish.

As we transition from MVP and MVE to Minimal Automation Concept (MAC), we’re shifting the focus from just getting something out the door to delivering something that truly adds value from day one. The core idea of MAC is simple yet powerful: prioritize automation and scalability early, and ensure that every part of the product provides complete value to the customer.

## Why is MAC the Future of Product Development?

### The End of the "Minimum" Mindset

Customers have grown tired of products that feel half-baked or experimental. “Good enough” no longer cuts it in a world where expectations are sky-high. Instead, MAC pushes us to deliver products that are fully formed, thoroughly tested, and ready to scale.

### Automation as the Differentiator

Automation isn’t just a nice-to-have anymore; it’s a competitive advantage. MAC places automation at the forefront of development, reducing manual effort, streamlining operations, and allowing teams to scale faster than ever before. It helps eliminate friction and enables a seamless customer experience.

### Building for Long-Term Success, Not Just Quick Wins

While MVP and MVE were often about testing a hypothesis or hitting a deadline, MAC emphasizes building products with long-term viability in mind. It’s about creating scalable solutions from the get-go—solutions that grow with demand and adapt over time. It’s no longer just about proving an idea; it’s about creating a product that will evolve with the customer’s needs.

### Creating Seamless, Integrated Experiences

With MAC, we’re no longer piecing together different features or hoping for quick fixes to later problems. The aim is to design complete solutions that integrate automation where it counts, ensuring that customers experience smooth, end-to-end value. Customers want consistency, reliability, and simplicity—and MAC helps deliver just that.

### Focusing on What Customers Will Actually Pay For

At the end of the day, what matters most is whether the product truly solves a pain point for the customer. MAC forces teams to ask: Does this product do more than just meet basic needs? It pushes us to create solutions customers are willing to pay for—solutions that go beyond the bare minimum.

This isn’t just about starting fresh—it’s about leaving behind outdated approaches that no longer serve the customer or the team. By moving beyond MVP and MVE and embracing MAC, we can finally deliver on the promise of building products that customers don’t just accept, but actively choose to champion.

Let’s explore how this shift can revolutionize the way we think about product development and why it’s the key to unlocking long-term success.

## Examples of MAC in Action

- **Stripe**  
  By automating payment processing, Stripe has allowed developers to integrate payments seamlessly into their applications. Instead of manually managing payments or relying on clunky, unreliable third-party systems, Stripe offers an automated, end-to-end solution that saves time and enhances the customer experience. This level of automation allows users to focus on building their product, while Stripe handles the complexity of payments, making it a service that provides real value customers are willing to pay for.

- **Zapier**  
  Zapier automates workflows between apps, enabling users to connect thousands of different services without writing code. By automating these integrations, Zapier eliminates the need for manual work and increases efficiency. For customers, this means more time for productive work and less time spent on tedious tasks. The simplicity and reliability of Zapier’s automation make it a tool that adds immense value, driving users to subscribe and pay for its services.

- **GitHub Actions**  
  GitHub Actions is a prime example of automation transforming developer workflows. By automating Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) processes, GitHub Actions streamlines the development cycle, reduces the risk of human error, and ensures that deployments are consistent and reliable. This level of automation not only makes developers’ jobs easier but also improves the overall quality of the product. GitHub Actions takes care of the tedious tasks, allowing developers to focus on innovation, and making it a service that is indispensable and worth paying for.

## How to Build a MAC

Building a MAC product requires a strategic approach. Here’s how you can start:

1. **Start with Automation**  
   Think about every aspect of the product that can be automated. From deployment pipelines to testing and monitoring, automation is crucial for efficiency. Identify where manual processes create bottlenecks and look for opportunities to automate them.

2. **Focus on Complete Solutions**  
   Build your product with the end-to-end experience in mind. Don’t just solve part of the problem. Whether it’s a feature, integration, or customer interaction, ensure that it is designed to be seamless and complete, even in the early stages.

3. **Design for Scalability**  
   Plan for growth. Whether you expect increased users, traffic, or data, ensure that your infrastructure and product design can handle it. Use cloud-native tools, modular architecture, and scalable databases to create a product that can evolve with demand.

4. **Embed Feedback Loops**  
   MAC is about continuous improvement. After the initial launch, integrate feedback loops that allow customers to provide input on what works and what doesn’t. Use this data to make iterative improvements and keep automating to enhance the user experience over time.

5. **Prioritize Customer Value**  
   Always ask yourself: How does this feature or automation solve a problem for the customer? Focus on what will make their experience easier, more efficient, and more reliable. By keeping customer needs at the core of your decisions, you ensure that your product not only meets expectations but exceeds them.

## In Conclusion

The future of product development is here, and it’s built on the principles of Minimal Automation Concept (MAC). By embracing automation, focusing on complete solutions, and thinking about long-term scalability, we can create products that truly deliver value from day one. No longer will customers have to settle for “good enough”—they will get products that solve their problems end-to-end and make their lives better.

MAC is the next step in product development evolution, and it’s time we start building products that customers are not just accepting, but actively love and rely on. The shift to MAC is about more than just creating a product; it’s about creating an experience that lasts, grows, and continues to delight customers.
