# 10 Microservice Anti-Patterns Every Engineer Must Avoid

In my previous article, we explored how microservices communicate—from synchronous APIs to event-driven designs and orchestration models. These patterns are the foundation of resilient architectures.

But communication alone doesn’t guarantee success. What happens when our services become too chatty? Too tightly coupled? Or so fragmented that we can’t make sense of them anymore?

That’s where this follow-up comes in.

In this article, we’ll dive into 10 common microservice anti-patterns—quiet mistakes that creep in and slowly erode performance, reliability, and developer sanity. For each one, I’ll explain the problem, why it matters, and how to fix it.

If solid communication patterns are about building highways between services, this piece is about preventing those highways from becoming traffic jams.

## Why Engineers Must Know These Anti-Patterns

Microservices promise scalability, flexibility, and decentralization—but those benefits can quickly turn into burdens if you’re not careful. It’s easy to fall into traps that seem harmless at first but snowball over time.

Common anti-patterns often result in:

- Maintenance headaches from bloated or entangled services
- Performance issues due to excessive communication overhead
- Scalability bottlenecks from poor service design
- Operational complexity that slows down debugging and releases

Recognizing these pitfalls helps us build systems that are easier to scale, evolve, and maintain.

## 1. The God Service

- **What It Is**: A single microservice that tries to do too much.  
- **Why It’s Bad**: Violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), creates tight coupling, and becomes a bottleneck for both scalability and maintenance.  
- **Fix It**: Use Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to break the service into smaller, cohesive components, each responsible for a specific domain area.  
- **Example**: Instead of one service handling authentication, orders, payments, and inventory—split them into separate services aligned with their domain.

## 2. Too Many Microservices

- **What It Is**: Excessively granular services that fragment the system.  
- **Why It’s Bad**: Adds communication overhead, complicates deployments, and hinders performance.  
- **Fix It**: Find the right granularity using DDD. Group responsibilities that naturally belong together. Avoid creating a separate service for every minor concern.  
- **Example**: If a user-preference service frequently triggers notifications, managing both in a single service can simplify coordination and improve performance.

## 3. Shared Database

- **What It Is**: Multiple services accessing and modifying the same database schema.  
- **Why It’s Bad**: Creates tight coupling and shared state, making changes risky and limiting scalability.  
- **Fix It**: Give each service its own database. Use APIs or asynchronous messaging for inter-service communication.  
- **Example**: Replace shared database access with event-driven updates or service-layer APIs that synchronize state when necessary.

## 4. Violating SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

- **What It Is**: A service that handles unrelated concerns under one roof.  
- **Why It’s Bad**: Leads to bloated, fragile services that are hard to test, evolve, or scale independently.  
- **Fix It**: Refactor services to focus on a single responsibility. Align service boundaries with business capabilities.  
- **Example**: Separate authentication logic from user profile management, even if they both deal with users.

## 5. Spaghetti Architecture

- **What It Is**: A tangled web of inter-service dependencies and direct calls.  
- **Why It’s Bad**: Makes it hard to understand, debug, or modify services without introducing regressions.  
- **Fix It**: Define clear service boundaries. Avoid hidden dependencies. Stick to well-defined API contracts and avoid circular dependencies.  
- **Example**: Instead of allowing every service to call every other, define explicit APIs and use gateways or messaging layers to enforce directionality.

## 6. Chatty Microservices

- **What It Is**: Excessive back-and-forth communication between services.  
- **Why It’s Bad**: Increases latency, overloads the network, and complicates error handling.  
- **Fix It**: Reduce the number of interactions by batching requests or combining operations. Reevaluate if all functionality needs to be distributed.  
- **Example**: Instead of five separate API calls to fetch user data, preferences, and status, provide a consolidated endpoint that returns all relevant information in one go.

## 7. No Fault Tolerance

- **What It Is**: Services that fail without retries, timeouts, or graceful degradation.  
- **Why It’s Bad**: A single failure can cascade and bring down the system.  
- **Fix It**: Implement resilience mechanisms like retries, timeouts, circuit breakers, and fallbacks.  
- **Example**: Use libraries like Resilience4j or Hystrix to gracefully handle transient failures and keep core functionality available.

## 8. Leaky Abstractions

- **What It Is**: Services exposing internal details like database structure or implementation logic.  
- **Why It’s Bad**: Creates tight coupling and brittle integrations. Any internal change can break consumers.  
- **Fix It**: Design APIs that expose meaningful, stable abstractions. Hide implementation details behind clear contracts.  
- **Example**: Instead of exposing raw database tables, provide domain-specific API endpoints that encapsulate logic and return clean, semantic responses.

## 9. Overusing Choreography

- **What It Is**: Relying solely on event-driven choreography without coordination.  
- **Why It’s Bad**: Leads to unpredictable workflows and logic that’s hard to trace or debug.  
- **Fix It**: Use orchestration when workflows have clear sequencing. Introduce central coordination when visibility or control is needed.  
- **Example**: For multi-step order fulfillment, use a workflow engine (like Temporal or Camunda) to orchestrate the steps instead of chaining events blindly.

## 10. No Observability

- **What It Is**: Lack of monitoring, tracing, and logging in services.  
- **Why It’s Bad**: Makes it nearly impossible to understand system behavior, debug issues, or ensure performance.  
- **Fix It**: Implement distributed tracing, structured logging, and metrics collection. Use dashboards to visualize system health.  
- **Example**: Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, and ELK stacks can provide full visibility into service behavior and dependencies.

## Bonus: No API Versioning

- **What It Is**: Changing APIs without backward compatibility or version control.  
- **Why It’s Bad**: Breaks clients and leads to deployment chaos.  
- **Fix It**: Use semantic versioning. Version your APIs (e.g., /api/v1/...). Maintain old versions until clients can migrate safely.  
- **Example**: Avoid breaking changes by introducing new versions alongside existing endpoints, and deprecate old ones with a clear timeline.

## Final Thoughts

Microservices give us flexibility—but only when wielded with care. By watching for these anti-patterns, you can build systems that scale with your team, not against it. Design with intention, and your architecture won’t just survive—it’ll thrive.
