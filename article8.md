# Unwrapping Lessons from 2024: A Holiday Guide for Engineers

As the year wraps up and the festive season surrounds us, I'm reflecting with gratitude on the insights, practices, and collaborations that have made this year fulfilling as a software engineer. It's been a year filled with challenges, learning, and growthâ€Šâ€”â€Šand I wouldn't have it any other way.

Reflecting on 2024, I'm especially thankful for the joy I still find in codingâ€Šâ€”â€Šmy zen place. This year, I've had the privilege of writing resilient code, strengthening platforms, designing scalable systems, and delivering key initiatives at work. Collaboration across various roles in my organization kept the year exciting and innovative. Between on-call engineering duties and key initiatives, I even found time for pet projects that nurtured my creativity and sense of accomplishment. 

Looking ahead to 2025, I'm eager to tackle new challenges, simplify systems, and strengthen core foundations to drive innovation.

In the spirit of giving, I wanted to share some gifts of knowledge, practices, and lessons that have enriched my journey. To keep things festive, I've categorized these as **"Gifts Under the Tree"** and **"Stocking Stuffers."**

## ðŸŽ„ Gifts Under the Tree (Big, Impactful Wins)

### Discovering Books and Podcasts
This year, I set a goal to read 10 books but managed to finish only five. To make up for the gap, I turned to podcasts and audiobooks during my commutes, making full use of my employer's Spotify Premium perk. One standout was *Atomic Habits*, a book packed with insights on personal growth and productivity. I'd read chapters at night and listen to the audiobook of the same chapters during my drives, reinforcing the lessons and helping them stick. These resources became my "feast for the mind," fueling growth and reflection.

### Identifying Areas for Excellence
I focused on recognizing areas of excellence and implementing smaller, impactful improvements. Casual coffee chats often sparked ideas for addressing shared challenges, highlighting how meaningful change can begin with small adjustments. One example was streamlining a manual release process, which eventually evolved into a team-wide improvement initiative.

### Seeking Impact Beyond My Team
Growth often stems from stepping outside your immediate circle. Through casual coffee chats, I worked with cross-functional teams on initiatives like automating our release process to reduce manual effort. These collaborations expanded my perspective and created opportunities to drive impact beyond my team.

### Getting Comfortable Being Uncomfortable
Leaning into the discomfort of learning new techniques has been a powerful way for me to acquire valuable skills. For example, when I discovered GitHub's workflow feature during a lunch-and-learn session, it sparked the idea to automate parts of our code review process, which earned me appreciation from the team. Embracing the unknown has not only expanded my skill set but also significantly boosted my confidence in problem-solving.

### Bringing the Bigger Picture into Focus
I've always thought about the bigger picture, but this year I truly saw the value of understanding context beyond the immediate task. By leveraging tools like Datadog alongside this broader perspective, I was able to quickly identify root causes and resolve complex P1 incidentsâ€Šâ€”â€Ševen those extending beyond our team. For instance, tracing anomalies back to upstream dependencies saved hours of debugging. This deeper understanding not only helped me manage incidents more effectively but also strengthened my systems thinking, allowing me to approach problems more strategically.

### Asking Questions
This year, I made a conscious effort to ask questions in meetings, no matter the audience. The feedback I received was overwhelmingly positive, with peers often thanking me for voicing questions they had but hesitated to ask. In one design review, my question about overlooked edge cases sparked a critical discussion that improved the final solution.

### Expressing Gratitude
A simple "thank you" proved to be powerful in fostering mutual respect and strengthening relationships. For example, expressing gratitude to team members and sending personalized thank-you messages after a successful launch helped build a culture of respect and recognition following every key initiative.

### Handling Feedback
This year, I focused on tailoring feedback to context. When reviewing a junior engineer's code, I publicly praised their approach while privately suggesting ways to improve readability. This balanced approach ensured feedback was both encouraging and actionable, fostering trust and growth.

### Keeping a Cool Head
Staying calm under pressure proved invaluable, particularly during a production outage and challenging interactions with others. By maintaining professionalism and focusing on solutions, I was able to help guide the team to a quick resolution, all while reinforcing trust and fostering collaboration.

### Choosing the Right Battles
Not every issue is worth fighting over. I've learned to focus my energy on battles that align with broader goals. For example, sometimes letting others win is a strategic choice for long-term success, allowing me to conserve my efforts for key challenges that drive meaningful improvements without losing sight of the bigger picture.
