# Five Years Brewing: A Starbucks Memoir

Thanksgiving is a time for reflection, and this year, I find myself looking back on five transformative years at Starbucks—a community where partners come together with shared purpose and pride. With a steaming cup of coffee in hand, I’m reminded that Starbucks has become so much more than a workplace.

As I reflect on this journey, I’m grateful for how much I’ve learned and grown—and for the exciting opportunities ahead. Each memory tells a story of transformation, challenges, and countless moments of connection that have shaped me both personally and professionally.

Let me share a few of the lessons and experiences that have made this journey so meaningful as I continue to grow and thrive at Starbucks.

## 1. The Power of Team Culture

At Starbucks, I’ve experienced a team culture like no other. It’s a space where blamelessness thrives—where mistakes are seen not as failures but as opportunities to learn and grow. This absence of judgment created an environment of trust and safety.

One moment that truly shaped my understanding of this culture came during a 1:1 meeting with my skip-level manager when I first joined Starbucks. I apologized for a mistake I had made, and he responded with something that resonated deeply with me: 

> "Never be apologetic about a mistake. Take it as a learning moment. There are millions of ways to make mistakes, but just don’t repeat the same one."

His reaction was both enlightening and confidence-boosting, unlocking a lot of my potential. It reminded me that growth comes from owning our mistakes and learning from them, and that attitude has shaped my approach to challenges ever since.

Working with talented and supportive colleagues, I’ve seen firsthand the power of mutual encouragement and a shared commitment to excellence. This environment empowered me to take risks, learn from setbacks, and thrive in a community built on trust and support.

## 2. Freedom to Speak

One of the most transformative aspects of my journey was the freedom to speak—to ask questions, challenge the status quo, and voice my perspective. It’s not just about sharing ideas—it’s about engaging in conversations where understanding and respect are at the forefront.

Whether challenging a long-standing process or proposing a new approach to problem-solving, I always felt supported in bringing fresh perspectives to the table. Leaders and colleagues didn’t just hear my voice—they sought to understand the "why" behind my ideas, fostering a culture of curiosity and thoughtful dialogue.

In this environment, I’ve grown as a communicator, learning to express my thoughts with clarity and purpose while appreciating the perspectives of others. This spirit of open dialogue has not only enriched my work but also deepened my connections with the people around me.

## 3. Endless Learning

The journey of learning at Starbucks is endless, and each day offers something new. Whether it’s perfecting a technical detail, refining processes, or approaching engineering with greater intention, I’ve come to value the pursuit of excellence in everything I do.

One of the most impactful experiences was during a migration project I wasn’t directly responsible for. I took it upon myself to go beyond my immediate role and identify the right dataset, ensuring that every corner case was thoroughly tested and addressed. It wasn’t just about getting the migration done—it was about precision, diligence, and foresight in addressing challenges before they arose. 

By covering every possible edge case, we achieved a 99% success rate in the migration, which felt incredibly rewarding. This experience reinforced my understanding of how the smallest details and careful planning can make a huge difference. Working alongside a team that prioritizes resilience, ownership, and cost-efficiency has been a constant reminder that excellence lies in the details.

## 4. Living the Mission and Values

At Starbucks, the company’s mission and values weren’t just slogans; they were lived every day. Decisions were made with empathy and a human lens, always keeping partners and customers at the heart of the process. This alignment of words and actions inspired me to lead with authenticity and purpose. 

Coming from the fast-paced Silicon Valley environment, I found Starbucks’ focus on intentionality and balance to be a refreshing change. It created space for meaningful work and reminded me that impactful outcomes come from deliberate, thoughtful actions.

## 5. Growing Together

Perhaps the most profound lesson I’ve learned is the value of collective growth. At Starbucks, success isn’t measured by individual accomplishments or how quickly one climbs the corporate ladder. Instead, it’s about uplifting each other and celebrating shared victories.

This spirit of collaboration has been both humbling and fulfilling. I’ve come to realize that the journey is far more rewarding when we grow together. The impact of supporting one another goes beyond just completing a project or meeting a goal—it’s about the relationships that are built and the shared learning along the way. I’ve been fortunate to contribute to this environment, where every win feels like a team effort.

## Looking Ahead

As I look to the future, I’m filled with gratitude for the experiences, relationships, and lessons that have shaped me. I’m excited to embrace new challenges, continue learning, and contribute to this incredible community. I know the opportunities ahead will be just as rewarding as the ones that have already shaped my journey.

Thank you, Starbucks, for an unforgettable journey. Here’s to many more adventures and shared successes!
